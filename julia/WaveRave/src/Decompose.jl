"""
    Decompose a 1D array into n subdomains.

# Arguments
- `array:: AbstractArray{Real, 1}`: The array to be decomposed.
- `x_values:: AbstractArray{Real, 1}`: The x values for the array.
- `id:: Int`: The ID of the subdomain to be returned.
- `id_max:: Int`: The total number of subdomains.
- `overlap:: Int`: The number of points of overlap between subdomains.
- `boundary_fill:: Symbol`: The method for filling the boundary of the 
    subdomain. Options are:
    - `:wraparound`: The boundary is filled with the opposite side of the 
        array.
    - `:zero`: The boundary is filled with zeros.
    - `:repeat`: The boundary is filled with the nearest value.
