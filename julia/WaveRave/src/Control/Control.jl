    A struct to hold the control parameters for the simulation

# Arguments
    coords: coordinates along each dimension. Should be evenly sampled.
    p_velocity: An array of velocities in (m/s)
    sources: An array of sources to fire in the simulation.
    time_max: Time to run the simulation, in seconds.
    receivers: An array of receivers for recording wavefields.
    cfl_limit: The CFL limit to enforce. 0.5 is recommended.
    nodes_per_wavelength: The number of nodes per wavelength to enforce.
        The slowest velocity in the simulation and highest frequency source
        will be used to calculate the wavelength.
    distribution_strategy: The strategy to use for distributing the simulation
        across the processors. options are: 
        :grid - The domian is decomposed into evenly sized block subdomains.
        :stip - The domain is decomposed into evenly sized strip subdomains.
    distributed_shape: The shape of each distributed chunk.
    space_order: The number of points right of the centeral point for the 
        derivative estimation in space. Centeral is always used.
    time_order: The number of points right of the centeral point for the 
        derivative estimation in space. Centeral is always used.
    dt: time step in seconds, if None calculate based on CFL.
